# **EMAIL CONTENT:**
{email}

---

# **Notes:**

* Focus on extracting specific identifiers when possible (e.g., "Where is truck #1234?")
* If no specific identifier is provided but the query is clear (e.g., "Where are all our trucks?"), categorize it appropriately
* If the email mentions multiple query types, prioritize the main request or the most complex data need
* Pay special attention to temporal indicators (e.g., "yesterday", "last week", "historical", "current")
* For time-based queries, try to extract the specific time window if mentioned
* Look for requests about specific location details like addresses, street names, or landmarks
* Distinguish clearly between current data requests ("where is X now") and historical data requests ("where was X yesterday")
